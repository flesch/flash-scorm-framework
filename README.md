# VZW Flash SCORM Framework

## Building

The framework comes with a `build` script to help you move files to the VZLearn Staging server.

It's held in the `bin` folder, so on the command line you'll want to navigate there.

    $ cd bin

Simply running `build` will push (or sync) your local copy up to the remote savage drive.

    $ build

If you're curious about what else `build.bat` will do, `help` is included.

    $ build --help
